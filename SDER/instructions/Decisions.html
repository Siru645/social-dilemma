<div class="instructions-subheading">Starting Balances and Random Number Draws</div>
<p>
    In this experiment, each participant has an Individual Account, and each group of 4 shares a Group Account.
    The experiment begins with <span class="tokens">10 tokens</span> in each Individual Account.
    The initial number of tokens in the Group Account is unknown to you, between 0 and 40.

    Before your decision, you will also be assigned a random number between 0 and 10</b>. This number
    of tokens will be added to the starting balance of the Group Account. The remaining tokens out of 10 will be
    paid to you as part of your final payoff. This process happens for each member, but you will only know your
    own number.
    <ul id="remember-list">
      <li><span class="tokens">Tokens</span> are worth <span class="ecu">3 ECUs</span> in the <b>Group Account</b> (0.75 ECUs per group member)</li>
      <li><span class="tokens">Tokens</span> are worth <span class="ecu">1 ECU</span> in your <b>Individual Account</b></li>
    </ul>
</p>

<div class="instructions-subheading">Binding Decisions</div>
<p>
    Because you only know the random number of tokens drawn for you, and not the other members of your group, you
    will not know the initial balance of the Group Account before you make your decision. So, we ask you to submit
    binding decisions covering all possible starting balances of the Group Account.
</p>

<div class="instructions-subheading">Decision Task</div>
<p id="decision-task-list">
    Each person will privately decide to either:
    <ul>
        <li>move up to <b>10 tokens from their Individual Account</b> to the Group Account, <b><i>or</i></b></li>
        <li>move up to <b>1/4 of the tokens from the Group Account</b> to their Individual Account</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<div class="instructions-subheading">Earnings</div>
<p>
    After all individuals have made their decision, you will be told the average random number drawn among the
    other 3 group members, which of your decisions is played, the final Group Account balance, and your earnings from
    the Group and Individual Accounts. The final value of the Group Account will be divided equally among all
    individuals in the group. For each individual in the group, their total earnings will be combined with the
    amount that the individual has remaining in their Individual Account from Decision 1 and equally distributed
    final Group Account.
</p>
<p><b>
    Your total earnings will be the remaining tokens drawn after the random number of tokens is added to the Group
    Account, the final value of tokens (in ECUs) in your Individual Account, and one-fourth of the final value of
    tokens in the Group Account (in ECUs).

    Any tokens left in your Individual Account after Decision 1 will be converted to U.S. dollars using a

    In Decision 2, each individual begins with <span class="tokens">10 tokens</span> in their Individual Account.

    You will not know the total amount of tokens in the Group Account from Decision 1 until you finish
