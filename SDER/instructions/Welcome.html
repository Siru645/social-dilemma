<b>No Talking Allowed</b>
<p>
    Now that the experiment has begun, we ask that you do not communicate with other participants. If you have any
    questions after we finish reading the instructions, please raise your hand and the experimenter will answer your
    question in private.
</p>

<b>Complete Privacy</b>
<p>
    This experiment is structured so that no one, including the experimenters or the other participants, will ever
    know your personal decision or money earnings in the experiment. This is accomplished by giving you the only key
    to a numbered mailbox that contains a sealed envelope with your earnings inside.
</p>
<p>
    Your privacy is guaranteed because neither your name nor student ID number will be entered into the computer
    that records your decisions in the experiment. The only identifying information that will be used is the number
    on the mailbox key that has been given to you. You will collect your money payoffs with privacy by using the key,
    which opens a mailbox located in the reception room. The key and mailbox are labeled with the same number.
    You are the only person who knows your key and mailbox number.
</p>

<b>One Round</b>
<p>
    There will be one decision task in this experiment. You will face the decision task only once, so you should
    take it seriously.
</p>

<b>Random Matching and Anonymity</b>
<p>
    You will be randomly matched with 3 other people to form a group of 4 individuals that will stay the same for
    the entire decision task.
</p>

<b>Cash Payoffs</b>
<p>
    Your earnings in this experiment are expressed in <i>Experimental Currency Units</i>, which we will refer to as
    ECUs. At the conclusion of the experiment you will be paid in U.S. dollars using a conversion rate of $1 for every
    {{exchange_rate}} ECU{{if exchange_rate != 1}} 's {{endif}} of earnings from the experiment.
